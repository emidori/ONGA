# ONGA
Music Player App for Android 


ONGA is a personal project that will be worked on a regular basis 
I have started with the following tutorial: 
https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-music-player-on-android-project-setup--mobile-22764


Using the tutorial as a base structure I will tweak errors, add my own functionality and update the repo with any future additions and changes that will be made. 

Current functionality: 
* See list of all songs on phone 
* Play/Stop/Pause/Skip Song/Skip a few seconds in the song 
* Suffle current list of songs (Cannot see current playlist) 
* Exit application 


Future additions:
* Ability to create/see playlist 
* Ability to listen to albums consecutively 
* Ability to add/edit lyrics 
* Organize songs by albums, artists 
* Tag songs/albums etc. 
* Change skins 
* Search functionality for songs
